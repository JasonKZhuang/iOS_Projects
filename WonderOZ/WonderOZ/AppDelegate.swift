// If you don't already have the CocoaPods tool, install it on macOS by running the following command from the terminal.
// #sudo gem install cocoapods
// Create a Podfile for the Google Maps SDK for iOS and use it to install the API and its dependencies
// Create a file named Podfile in your project directory. This file defines your project's dependencies.
// Edit the Podfile and add your dependencies. Here is an example which includes the dependencies you need for the Google Maps SDK for iOS and Places API for iOS (optional):
// *****************************************************//
// source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'      //
// target 'YOUR_APPLICATION_TARGET_NAME_HERE' do        //
//      pod 'GoogleMaps'                                //
//      pod 'GooglePlaces'                              //
// end                                                  //
// *****************************************************//
// Open a terminal and go to the directory containing the Podfile:
// Run the pod install command.
// This will install the APIs specified in the Podfile, along with any dependencies they may have.
// #pod install
// Close Xcode, and then open (double-click) your project's .xcworkspace file to launch Xcode.
// From this time onwards, you must use the .xcworkspace file to open the project.

// error:
//The app's Info.plist must contain both NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription and NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription keys with string values explaining to the user how the app uses this data

// Error: Failed to load optimized model - GoogleMaps SDK IOS
// If you have already double-checked the basic setup for the "google maps ios-sdk" with an APIkey for your app's bundle identifier here and still have the same problem
//  then probably you have not enabled the google maps API. Go to your app-project's dashboard on https://console.developers.google.com and click the "ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES". There, under the MAPS section select "the Google maps sdk for ios" and enable it.
